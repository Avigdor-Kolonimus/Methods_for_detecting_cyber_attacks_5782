# Methods for detecting cyber attacks

## Introduction[](#introduction)

The course of "Methods of detecting cyber attacks" by Ariel University in academic year 2021-2022. The course was divided into two parts. In the first step, I took part in the [Malware Detection and Classification Challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1357/evaluation), which was sponsored by Cisco. The second step was to pick some kind of scientific paper related to the course topic and improved its results.

## Challenge[](#challenge)

According to the introduction, this is the "Malware Detection and Classification Challenge". There are datasets in the [folder](./CISCO%20challenge/datasets) that we received for different phases, but the dataset for Zero-day isn't there. No changes were made to the file [code](./CISCO%20challenge/code.ipynb) for all phases. A [presentation](./CISCO%20challenge/slides.pptx) file was presented to the CISCO judges. In the Zero-day phase, the second place was taken, but the overall result is 1st place.
