# Methods for detecting cyber attacks

## Introduction[](#introduction)

The course of "Methods of detecting cyber attacks" by Ariel University in academic year 2021-2022. The course was divided into two parts. In the first step, I took part in the [Malware Detection and Classification Challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1357/evaluation), which was sponsored by Cisco. The second step was to pick some kind of scientific paper related to the course topic and improved its results.
